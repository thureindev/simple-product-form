This application showcases a simple product submission form. Below, you'll find specific information regarding the choices made in the code, especially the omission of database connection in favor of a hardcoded success message.

## Important Notes

### Database Connection

The original code block includes a template placeholder for connecting to a database and creating new products. However, this portion of the code has been commented out for this demo-only application.

#### Reason for Commenting Database Connection

- **Heroku's ClearDB Removal**: Since Heroku has removed its ClearDB free tier, we have decided not to invest in a paid option solely for this demonstration.
- **Simplification**: The code will simply print a hardcoded success message instead of actually creating a new product in the database.
